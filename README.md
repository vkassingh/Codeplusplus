# Codeplusplus

A live code editor for HTML, CSS and Javascript started on 21st march 2021. I started web development with brackets, then switched to sublime text. So getting a live preview of the html css js code took time. Sometimes it was buggy, sometimes my laptop hanged. It wasted a lot of time. This way Code++ came into existence. I feel there are many students and even professionals who are facing this problem, switching to different ides facing bugs while devoloping a website. This is the situation
where code++ can help you.
