# Codeplusplus

A live code editor for HTML, CSS and Javascript started on 21st march 2021. I dedicate this project to my family, to my teachers and professors.




I started web development with brackets, then switched to sublime text. So getting a live preview of the html css js code took time. Sometimes it was buggy, sometimes my laptop hanged. It wasted a lot of time. This way Code++ came into existence. I feel there are many students and even professionals who are facing this problem, switching to different ides facing bugs while devoloping a website. This is the situation
where code++ can help you.

## Any kind of contributions are most welcome ðŸ¤˜

## Why Code++ ?
1. You do not need a high end laptop. 
2. You do not need an IDE
3. You can code from anywhere
4. You can collaborate in real time with your teammate
